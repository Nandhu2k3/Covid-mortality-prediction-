# COVID Mortality Prediction

This project aims to predict the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients using decision tree and random forest algorithms. By analyzing demographic, medical, and clinical data from the Mexican Health Department archives, the models help identify high-risk individuals who may require additional care or intervention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Mexican Health Department archives. It contains comprehensive information about COVID-19 patients, including demographic details, pre-existing medical conditions, laboratory test results, and clinical symptoms.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Decision Tree Model:** Train a decision tree model on the training data. Tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

3. **Random Forest Model:** Implement a random forest algorithm by combining multiple decision trees. Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning and evaluate its performance.

4. **Model Comparison and Selection:** Compare the performance of the decision tree and random forest models based on evaluation metrics and interpretability. Select the superior model.

5. **Deployment and Future Considerations:** Develop a user-friendly interface (e.g., web application, API) to showcase the trained model's functionality. Discuss potential real-world applications and limitations of the models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-mortality-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Ensure you have obtained the dataset from the Mexican Health Department archives and place it in the project's data directory.
4. Run the notebooks in the given order to replicate the project steps.
5. Modify the code and experiment with different approaches as needed.
